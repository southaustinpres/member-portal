SAPC Member Portal
==================

Development Setup
-----------------

Install PostgreSQL on your machine. How you do this will depend on your
operating system. (On a Mac, installing using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
is as easy as `brew install postgresql`.) Once PostgreSQL is installed, create
the member portal database by running the following command:

    createdb sapcmemberportal
